long after the rain 
the pregnant woman 
swims into the mud 

winter wind 
the baby hippo sings 
on the sidewalk 

The Poet 
is 
<nl>

jewel of the julie 
of the forbidden world 
that is the art of knowledge and kin

autumn creek 
the fox's eyes 
in the closet shop 

a ladder 
reaches the door 
winter stars 

evening fog--- 
the cat opens 
screen

December sunset--- 
the smell of coffee 
in the subway 

salt pans 
the railway kettle 
a little laugh 

winter solstice 
the warmth of the birthmark 
on the shop-window

gently wordlessly 
the spider 
<nl>
in the kitchen sink 

behind the door 
the smell of water 
on the river-bed

city hospital drive . . . 
everything comes on 
all the night 

family squabble 
one clock 
runs away

first raindrops -- 
the 
smile 
becomes dead

abel 
life hast thou bestead 
farewell thee for this first

rainy morning 
the girl asks me 
a dandelion dog 

Tramps doze 
on the white fog 
and patter

Ah, 
<nl>
not a tenderness of joy 
the moon come into the bend of the world 
in the eternal heat and long 

my own humble heart 
and looked for you at me beside the mead 
of heavenly thrones 

summer rains 
the sparking fish 
the street grin 

wandering 
on both directions 
summer wind 

what we know i don?t understand 
a mother in the basket 
the same men with a quarter of a field 
to be a turn 
which is left

insomnia 
the war return 
to reach their torches

In a courtyard and hill and 
The happy 
<nl>
And washed with the wine of the song; 
And the heart of the organ mounting 
sea.

Epoch 30

0.5

after the rainstorm 
the scent of lilacs 
in the subway 

sudden downpour 
a lizard rides the paws 
in the rain 

my future 
packed in the garden 
the smell of rain

winter rain 
the warmth of my hand 
on the shoulder 

Madison Square Park--- 
German helmets 
attached with a buddha 

unmade path 
the sound of blue 
piercing

light - 
the sound of chairs 
against the maple 

memorial day 
missing the quilts 
under my coffee cup

now i pray then tell the man 
all the things i guess with the doubt 

circumcision may go 
to god's do the neighbors 
not of their priest 

spring rain . . . 
to the sound of 
<nl>
these white heron

0.3

early spring 
the sound of a goose 
chewing skin

I do not 
<nl>
understand. 

sound of the clocktower 
the scent of lilacs 
on the harbour

0.7

autumn mist . . . 
a wave of dust 
in the field 

master potter 
the new neighbor 
tries his tune 

No deceit, uncommonly 
No 
No 
My boy will 
no less. 

burning winter 
a few blocks closer 
than a snake 

pink sky 
a mosquito wing tilts 
in the daytime

a rainbow 
passing down his path 
our reflections 

after the fireworks -- 
a glass 
owl rocks 
in the haze 

to every window 
<nl>
not broken 
<nl>
those colors

end of the day - 
the color of a penny 
by the horn 

simplicity the name the young name the girl of the village 
no woman has told me what we need 
then this should be so

river narrows 
the pitched tide 
of a spiral

field of poppies 
the pinto pony 
holds his own hair 

inside the house: 
a dog sniffs 
a paw 

swallow 
<nl>
the potter 

bend the baton 
and coconut 
the sky 

He sees the silver-blue moonlight, 
he loved 
And he cursed 
the folly of the 

Autumn rain 
the smell of ozone 
from a carp

1.1

ice-cold iron 
shaking flying in my mind 
somewhat wishing as they lie again 

charge over the dead grass 
the azure sky flooded me 
by autumn swans a man and flies 

first light 
two blackbirds fly 
from dusk 

tornado alley 
only in the tide 
a end of spring 

reflection 
on her soft hand -- 
winter rain 

crow feather? . . . 
snowflakes
